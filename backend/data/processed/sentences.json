    "An international ad hoc Working Group of experts in cancer research met at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in January 1979 to evaluate the data on human and experimental animal carcinogenicity for 54 chemicals, groups of chemicals, and industrial processes.",
    "Monographs for these chemicals were published in Vols.",
    "1 to 20 of the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans.",
    "Based on evidence from human studies, 18 of the 54 chemicals or industrial processes are human carcinogens.",
    "A further 18 chemicals are probably carcinogenic for humans, although the data were considered not adequate to establish a causal association.",
    "To reflect differing degrees of evidence of carcinogenicity within this group, the chemicals were further subdivided, with 6 chemicals exhibiting a high degree of evidence and 12 chemicals exhibiting a lower degree.",
    "Data on the remaining 18 chemicals were considered insufficient to allow any evaluation of carcinogenicity.",
    "The report summarizes the background, purpose, and overall conclusions of the Working Group.",
    "The evidence supporting the evaluations is given in the \"Appendix.\"",
    "We examined the effects of digitalis therapy on postinfarction mortality throughout a 24-month to 48-month follow-up in 867 patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction.",
    "During follow-up, 145 patients died (16.7% mortality).",
    "At the time of hospital discharge, 31% of the patients were taking digitalis.",
    "The digitalis-treated patients were older, had more medical-cardiac risk factors, and had a higher mortality rate throughout the follow-up than the nondigitalis-treated patients.",
    "Statistical techniques were used to adjust for clinical imbalances between the digitalis-treated patients and nondigitalis-treated patients.",
    "The survival analysis (n = 728 patients) utilized the Cox regression model, and the digitalis-associated mortality risk was identified only after all significant covariates were allowed, so that mortality could be predicted as accurately as possible.",
    "Digitalis therapy was associated with a significantly increased postinfarction mortality risk after adjustment for the predictor covariates (relative risk 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.7, p less than 0.001).",
    "The findings from this large multicenter study suggest that it would be prudent to exercise caution in the use of digitalis in postinfarction patients.",
    "Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia results in severe impairment of steroid biosynthesis in the adrenal glands and gonads that is manifested both in utero and postnatally.",
    "We recently found mutations in the gene for the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in four patients with this syndrome, but it was not clear whether all patients have such mutations or why there is substantial clinical variation in these patients.",
    "We directly sequenced the gene for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in 15 patients with congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia from 10 countries.",
    "Identified mutations were confirmed and recreated in expression vectors, transfected into cultured cells, and assayed for the presence and activity of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein.",
    "Fifteen different mutations in the gene for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein were found in 14 patients; the mutation Gln258Stop was found in 80 percent of affected alleles from Japanese and Korean patients, and the mutation Arg182Leu was found in 78 percent of affected alleles from Palestinian patients.",
    "We developed diagnostic tests for these and eight other mutations.",
    "Thirteen of the 15 mutations were in exons 5, 6, or 7, and all rendered the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein inactive in functional assays.",
    "Some mutants with amino acid replacements were capable of normal mitochondrial processing, indicating that the activity of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is not associated with its translocation into mitochondria.",
    "Steroidogenic cells lacking the protein retained low levels of steroidogenesis.",
    "This explains the secretion of some steroid hormones by the ovaries after puberty before affected cells accumulate large amounts of cholesterol esters.",
    "The congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia phenotype is the result of two separate events, an initial genetic loss of steroidogenesis that is dependent on steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and a subsequent loss of steroidogenesis that is independent of the protein due to cellular damage from accumulated cholesterol esters.",
    "Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with progressive bone-marrow failure, a variety of congenital abnormalities, and predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia.",
    "Cells from FA patients show increased sensitivity to bifunctional DNA crosslinking agents such as diepoxybutane and mitomycin C, with characteristic chromosome breakage.",
    "FA is genetically heterogeneous, at least five different complementation groups (FA-A to FA-E) having been described.",
    "The gene for group C (FAC) was cloned by functional complementation and mapped to chromosome 9q22.3 (refs 3, 5), but the genes for the other complementation groups have not yet been identified.",
    "The group A gene (FAA) has recently been mapped to chromosome 16q24.3 by linkage analysis, and accounts for 60-65% of FA cases.",
    "We narrowed the candidate region by linkage and allelic association analysis, and have isolated a gene that is mutated in FA-A patients.",
    "The gene encodes a protein of 1,455 amino acids that has no significant homology to any other known proteins, and may therefore represent a new class of genes associated with the prevention or repair of DNA damage.",
    "There is concern about possible association between PUVA treatment and an increased risk of noncutaneous cancer.",
    "An alteration in the risk of cancer among persons with psoriasis has also been postulated.",
    "To test this hypothesis, for nearly two decades we have prospectively followed 1380 patients who first began PUVA treatment for psoriasis in 1975-1976.",
    "We compare the risk of noncutaneous cancer in our cohort with that expected based on general population incidence rates.",
    "The overall risk of noncutaneous cancer was nearly identical to that expected in general population.",
    "For three separate sites, we noted significant increases: thyroid cancer (RR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.16-8.34), breast cancer (RR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.19-2.64), and central nervous system neoplasms (RR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.13-5.57).",
    "Since 1987, however, the risk of central nervous system neoplasms has not been elevated (RR = 0.00, 95% CI = 0.00-3.35) and the relative risk of breast cancer was lower than in the prior decade and not statistically significant.",
    "There was no association between higher levels of exposure to PUVA and the risk of any of these cancers.",
    "We did not detect any significant increase in the risk of lymphoma or leukemia.",
    "Our study does not support the hypothesis that long-term PUVA treatment increases the risk of noncutaneous cancer.",
    "Genetic linkage studies place a gene causing early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) on chromosome 14q24.3 (refs 1-4).",
    "Five mutations within the S182 (Presenilin 1: PS-1) gene, which maps to this region, have recently been reported in several early onset FAD kindreds.",
    "We have localized the PS-1 gene to a 75 kb region and present the structure of this gene, evidence for alternative splicing and describe six novel mutations in early onset FAD pedigrees all of which alter residues conserved in the STM2 (Presenilin 2: PS-2) gene.",
    "The European Society for Paediatric Gasteroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) issued two sets of recommendations for the treatment of infants with acute gastroenteritis (1992, 1997).",
    "The purpose of this multicentre study performed in 29 European countries was to determine how closely current treatment compares with the ESPGHAN recommendations.",
    "The outline of the study was based on a questionnaire that addressed the management of a 6-month-old infant with acute gastroenteritis complicated by mild to moderate dehydration.",
    "National coordinators circulated the questionnaire to randomly selected primary care physicians and to hospital-based paediatricians.",
    "A total of 2997 questionnaires were returned, of which 1768 were from Western Europe (WE) and 1229 from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).",
    "Eighty-four percent of responding physicians said they would follow the ESPGHAN recommendation to use oral rehydration solution (ORS) for rehydration, with 66% using an ORS containing 60 mmol/l sodium ORS.",
    "Only 16% (WE 15%, CEE 19%) would follow the guidelines and use rapid oral rehydration over 3 to 4 hours.",
    "Forty-five percent would rehydrate infants in a 3- to 6-hour period (WE 35%, CEE 60%), and 17% (WE 23%, CEE 9%) would extend the rehydration period to 12 to 24 hours.",
    "ESPGHAN recommendation of rapid reintroduction of normal feeding after 3 to 4 hours of oral rehydration would be followed by only 21% of responding physicians, and only 43% (WE 46%, CEE 38%) would start feeding with full-strength formula.",
    "However, the guideline about continuation of breast-feeding is widely followed (total 77%; WE 78%, CEE 75%).",
    "Thirty-six percent (WE 45%, CEE 23%) use a lactose-containing formula after successful oral rehydration.",
    "Contrary to the ESPGHAN guideline 35% (WE 30%, CEE 42%) would use a lactose-free formula and 19% (WE 12%, CEE 28%) a lactose and cow's milk protein-free formula.",
    "Only 37% (WE 30%, CEE 46%) of responding physicians would follow the recommendation to use ORS to replace ongoing losses from watery diarrhoea.",
    "The results of the survey suggest that with the exception of recommending ORS for rehydration and continuation of breast-feeding during diarrhoea, a minority of responding European physicians follow the ESPGHAN guidelines for optimal management of children with acute gastroenteritis.",
    "Destruction by oxidation, or oxidative killing, is the most important defense against surgical pathogens and depends on the partial pressure of oxygen in contaminated tissue.",
    "An easy method of improving oxygen tension in adequately perfused tissue is to increase the concentration of inspired oxygen.",
    "We therefore tested the hypothesis that the supplemental administration of oxygen during the perioperative period decreases the incidence of wound infection.",
    "We randomly assigned 500 patients undergoing colorectal resection to receive 30 percent or 80 percent inspired oxygen during the operation and for two hours afterward.",
    "Anesthetic treatment was standardized, and all patients received prophylactic antibiotic therapy.",
    "With use of a double-blind protocol, wounds were evaluated daily until the patient was discharged and then at a clinic visit two weeks after surgery.",
    "We considered wounds with culture-positive pus to be infected.",
    "The timing of suture removal and the date of discharge were determined by the surgeon, who did not know the patient's treatment-group assignment.",
    "Arterial oxygen saturation was normal in both groups; however, the arterial and subcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen was significantly higher in the patients given 80 percent oxygen than in those given 30 percent oxygen.",
    "Among the 250 patients who received 80 percent oxygen, 13 (5.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 8.0 percent) had surgical-wound infections, as compared with 28 of the 250 patients given 30 percent oxygen (11.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 7.3 to 15.1 percent; P=0.01).",
    "The absolute difference between groups was 6.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 10.8 percent).",
    "The duration of hospitalization was similar in the two groups.",
    "The perioperative administration of supplemental oxygen is a practical method of reducing the incidence of surgical-wound infections.",
    "Previous studies of lung function in relation to smoking cessation have not adequately quantified the long-term benefit of smoking cessation, nor established the predictive value of characteristics such as airway hyperresponsiveness.",
    "In a prospective randomized clinical trial at 10 North American medical centers, we studied 3, 926 smokers with mild-to-moderate airway obstruction (3,818 with analyzable results; mean age at entry, 48.5 yr; 36% women) randomized to one of two smoking cessation groups or to a nonintervention group.",
    "We measured lung function annually for 5 yr.",
    "Participants who stopped smoking experienced an improvement in FEV(1) in the year after quitting (an average of 47 ml or 2%).",
    "The subsequent rate of decline in FEV(1) among sustained quitters was half the rate among continuing smokers, 31 +/- 48 versus 62 +/- 55 ml (mean +/- SD), comparable to that of never-smokers.",
    "Predictors of change in lung function included responsiveness to beta-agonist, baseline FEV(1), methacholine reactivity, age, sex, race, and baseline smoking rate.",
    "Respiratory symptoms were not predictive of changes in lung function.",
    "Smokers with airflow obstruction benefit from quitting despite previous heavy smoking, advanced age, poor baseline lung function, or airway hyperresponsiveness.",
    "Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), characterized by obstruction of pre-capillary pulmonary arteries, leads to sustained elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure (mean >25 mm Hg at rest or >30 mm Hg during exercise).",
    "The aetiology is unknown, but the histological features reveal proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells with vascular remodelling (Fig.",
    "1).",
    "More than one affected relative has been identified in at least 6% of cases (familial PPH, MIM 178600).",
    "Familial PPH (FPPH) segregates as an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance and has been mapped to a locus designated PPH1 on 2q33, with no evidence of heterogeneity.",
    "We now show that FPPH is caused by mutations in BMPR2, encoding a TGF-beta type II receptor (BMPR-II).",
    "Members of the TGF-beta superfamily transduce signals by binding to heteromeric complexes of type I and II receptors, which activates serine/threonine kinases, leading to transcriptional regulation by phosphorylated Smads.",
    "By comparison with in vitro studies, identified defects of BMPR-II in FPPH are predicted to disrupt ligand binding, kinase activity and heteromeric dimer formation.",
    "Our data demonstrate the molecular basis of FPPH and underscore the importance in vivo of the TGF-beta signalling pathway in the maintenance of blood vessel integrity.",
    "Orthostatic intolerance is a common problem for inbound space travelers.",
    "There is usually tachycardia on standing but blood pressure may be normal, low or, rarely, elevated.",
    "This condition is analogous to the orthostatic intolerance that occurs on Earth in individuals with orthostatic tachycardia, palpitations, mitral valve prolapse, and light-headedness.",
    "Our studies during the Neurolab mission indicated that sympathetic nerve traffic is raised in microgravity and that plasma norepinephrine is higher than baseline supine levels but lower than baseline upright levels.",
    "A subgroup of patients with familial orthostatic intolerance differ from inbound space travelers in that they have an alanine-to-to-proline mutation at amino acid position 457 in their norepinephrine transporter gene.",
    "This leads to poor clearance of norepinephrine from synapses, with consequent raised heart rate.",
    "Clinical features of these syndromes are presented.",
    "Astronauts return to Earth with reduced red cell masses and hypovolaemia.",
    "Not surprisingly, when they stand, their heart rates may speed inordinately, their blood pressures may fall, and some may experience frank syncope.",
    "We studied autonomic function in six male astronauts (average +/- SEM age: 40 +/- 2 years) before, during, and after the 16-day Neurolab space shuttle mission.",
    "We recorded electrocardiograms, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressures, respiration, peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity, plasma noradrenaline and noradrenaline kinetics, and cardiac output, and we calculated stroke volume and total peripheral resistance.",
    "We perturbed autonomic function before and during spaceflight with graded Valsalva manoeuvres and lower body suction, and before and after the mission with passive upright tilt.",
    "In-flight baseline sympathetic nerve activity was increased above pre-flight levels (by 10-33%) in three subjects, in whom noradrenaline spillover and clearance also were increased.",
    "Valsalva straining provoked greater reductions of arterial pressure, and proportionally greater sympathetic responses in space than on Earth.",
    "Lower body suction elicited greater increases of sympathetic nerve activity, plasma noradrenaline, and noradrenaline spillover in space than on Earth.",
    "After the Neurolab mission, left ventricular stroke volume was lower and heart rate was higher during tilt, than before spaceflight.",
    "No astronaut experienced orthostatic hypotension or pre-syncope during 10 min of post-flight tilting.",
    "We conclude that baseline sympathetic outflow, however measured, is higher in space than on earth, and that augmented sympathetic nerve responses to Valsalva straining, lower body suction, and post-flight upright tilt represent normal adjustments to greater haemodynamic stresses associated with hypovolaemia.",
    "The aim of this study was to validate the Knee Society Clinical Rating System (knee and function scores) and to compare its responsiveness with that of the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36).",
    "Patients were recruited as part of a prospective observational study of the outcomes of primary total knee arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis in four centers in the United States, six centers in the United Kingdom, and two centers in Australia.",
    "Independent research assistants at each site collected the Knee Society clinical data.",
    "The WOMAC, SF-36, patient satisfaction, and demographic data were obtained with self-administered questionnaires.",
    "A total of 862 eligible patients were recruited, and complete preoperative and twelve-month data were available for 697 (80.9%) of them.",
    "The mean age was seventy years (range, thirty-eight to ninety years), and the majority of the patients (58.9%) were women.",
    "Low correlations were found among the items of both the knee and the function score at both assessment times.",
    "The Knee Society pain and function scores had moderate-to-strong correlations with the corresponding pain and function domains of the WOMAC and SF-36 (r = 0.31 to 0.72).",
    "Measurement of the standardized response mean showed the Knee Society knee score to be more responsive (standardized response mean, 2.2) than the WOMAC (standardized response means, 2.0 for pain and 1.4 for function) and the SF-36 (standardized response means, 1.0 for bodily pain and 1.1 for physical functioning).",
    "The Knee Society function score was the least responsive measure (standardized response mean, 0.8).",
    "Correlation of changes in scores at twelve months with patient reports of satisfaction and improvement in health status showed the WOMAC and SF-36 to be more responsive than the Knee Society scores.",
    "There is a poor correlation among the items of the Knee Society Clinical Rating System, but the rating system has adequate convergent construct validity.",
    "The WOMAC and SF-36 are more responsive measures of outcome of total knee arthroplasty.",
    "As they are less labor-intensive for researchers to use and as use of these instruments removes observer bias from the study design, they are preferable for knee arthroplasty outcome studies.",
    "We investigated the relationship of knee range of motion (ROM) and function in a prospective, observational study of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).",
    "Preoperative and 12-month data were collected on 684 patients, including knee ROM, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function questionnaire scores, patient satisfaction, and perceived improvement in quality of life (QOL).",
    "Only modest correlations were found between knee ROM and WOMAC function (r<0.34).",
    "At 12 months we found significantly worse WOMAC function scores for patients with <95 degrees flexion compared with patients with > or =95 degrees (mean, 61.9 vs 75.0; P<.0001).",
    "In linear regression models, WOMAC pain and function scores at 12 months were both correlates of patient satisfaction and perceived improvement in QOL (standardized beta>3.5; P<.0001), but knee flexion was not.",
    "For assessment of these outcomes, WOMAC function appears to be more important than knee flexion.",
    "To examine variation in the process of care for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and to highlight the need for rigorous research into the ideal management of TKA.",
    "We hypothesize that variation in the process of care for TKA across and within health care systems is associated with identifiable financial and historical factors.",
    "We compared access to TKA and typical postoperative rehabilitation management in 12 orthopedic centers in the United States (4 centers), United Kingdom (6 centers), and Australia (2 centers).",
    "We collected data from two sources: 1) Empirical data on length of stay and discharge management were collected as part of a prospective study of the outcomes of primary TKA for patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis; 2) Structured qualitative interviews were conducted at each of the participating centers to collect data on academic status and reimbursement structure, as well as waiting times for orthopedic consultation and TKA surgery once it had been scheduled.",
    "We demonstrated differences in length of acute hospital stay, use of extended care facilities, home physical therapy, and outpatient physical therapy within our cohort of hospitals.",
    "The publicly funded hospitals had a significantly longer acute hospital length of stay (mean 11.8 days, SD 7.1) than the private hospitals (mean 6.6 days, SD 4.1; P < 0.0001).",
    "Variation in waiting times was associated with the method of surgeon reimbursement and whether the hospital is publicly funded or private.",
    "Patients attending private hospitals waited 1-8 weeks for the first consultation and 2-12 weeks for a surgical date after scheduling.",
    "In contrast, patients attending publicly funded hospitals waited 4-12 months for a first consultation and 12-18 months for a surgical date after scheduling.",
    "Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that financial reimbursement schemes influence the management of TKA.",
    "Further research needs to be done to quantify effects of varying processes of care on the outcome of TKA surgery across different health care settings.",
    "This data would elucidate the optimal management of TKA using objective evidence rather than relying on financial incentives or the preservation of historical practices.",
    "Little information exists on the economic impact of chronic prostatitis.",
    "The objective of this study was to determine the direct and indirect costs associated with chronic prostatitis.",
    "Outcomes were assessed using a questionnaire designed to capture health care resource utilization.",
    "Resource estimates were converted into unit costs with direct medical cost estimates based on hospital cost-accounting data and indirect costs based on modified labor force, employment, and earnings data from the US Census Bureau.",
    "The total direct costs for the 3 months prior to entry into the cohort, excluding hospitalization, were $126 915 for the 167 study participants for an average of $954 per person among the 133 consumers.",
    "Of the men, 26% reported work loss valued at an average of $551.",
    "The average total costs (direct and indirect) for the 3 months was $1099 per person for those 137 men who had resource consumption with an expected annual total cost per person of $4397.",
    "For those study participants with any incurred costs, tests for association revealed that the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (P<.001) and each of the 3 subcategories of pain (P =.003), urinary function (P =.03), and quality-of-life (P =.002) were significantly associated with resource use, although the quality-of-life subscale score from the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index was the only predictor of resource consumption.",
    "Chronic prostatitis is associated with substantial costs and lower quality-of-life scores, which predicted resource consumption.",
    "The economic impact of chronic prostatitis warrants increased medical attention and resources to identify and test effective treatment strategies.",
    "Lung-volume-reduction surgery has been proposed as a palliative treatment for severe emphysema.",
    "Effects on mortality, the magnitude and durability of benefits, and criteria for the selection of patients have not been established.",
    "A total of 1218 patients with severe emphysema underwent pulmonary rehabilitation and were randomly assigned to undergo lung-volume-reduction surgery or to receive continued medical treatment.",
    "Overall mortality was 0.11 death per person-year in both treatment groups (risk ratio for death in the surgery group, 1.01; P=0.90).",
    "After 24 months, exercise capacity had improved by more than 10 W in 15 percent of the patients in the surgery group, as compared with 3 percent of patients in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001).",
    "With the exclusion of a subgroup of 140 patients at high risk for death from surgery according to an interim analysis, overall mortality in the surgery group was 0.09 death per person-year, as compared with 0.10 death per person-year in the medical-therapy group (risk ratio, 0.89; P=0.31); exercise capacity after 24 months had improved by more than 10 W in 16 percent of patients in the surgery group, as compared with 3 percent of patients in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001).",
    "Among patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity, mortality was lower in the surgery group than in the medical-therapy group (risk ratio for death, 0.47; P=0.005).",
    "Among patients with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high exercise capacity, mortality was higher in the surgery group than in the medical-therapy group (risk ratio, 2.06; P=0.02).",
    "Overall, lung-volume-reduction surgery increases the chance of improved exercise capacity but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy.",
    "It does yield a survival advantage for patients with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low base-line exercise capacity.",
    "Patients previously reported to be at high risk and those with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high base-line exercise capacity are poor candidates for lung-volume-reduction surgery, because of increased mortality and negligible functional gain.",
    "Knowledge of the physiological effects of extended (24 hours or more) work shifts in postgraduate medical training is limited.",
    "We aimed to quantify work hours, sleep, and attentional failures among first-year residents (postgraduate year 1) during a traditional rotation schedule that included extended work shifts and during an intervention schedule that limited scheduled work hours to 16 or fewer consecutive hours.",
    "Twenty interns were studied during two three-week rotations in intensive care units, each during both the traditional and the intervention schedule.",
    "Subjects completed daily sleep logs that were validated with regular weekly episodes (72 to 96 hours) of continuous polysomnography (r=0.94) and work logs that were validated by means of direct observation by study staff (r=0.98).",
    "Seventeen of 20 interns worked more than 80 hours per week during the traditional schedule (mean, 84.9; range, 74.2 to 92.1).",
    "All interns worked less than 80 hours per week during the intervention schedule (mean, 65.4; range, 57.6 to 76.3).",
    "On average, interns worked 19.5 hours per week less (P<0.001), slept 5.8 hours per week more (P<0.001), slept more in the 24 hours preceding each working hour (P<0.001), and had less than half the rate of attentional failures while working during on-call nights (P=0.02) on the intervention schedule as compared with the traditional schedule.",
    "Eliminating interns' extended work shifts in an intensive care unit significantly increased sleep and decreased attentional failures during night work hours.",
    "The National Emphysema Treatment Trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing lung-volume-reduction surgery with medical therapy for severe emphysema, included a prospective economic analysis.",
    "After pulmonary rehabilitation, 1218 patients at 17 medical centers were randomly assigned to lung-volume-reduction surgery or continued medical treatment.",
    "Costs for the use of medical care, medications, transportation, and time spent receiving treatment were derived from Medicare claims and data from the trial.",
    "Cost effectiveness was calculated over the duration of the trial and was estimated for 10 years of follow-up with the use of modeling based on observed trends in survival, cost, and quality of life.",
    "Interim analyses identified a group of patients with excess mortality and little chance of improved functional status after surgery.",
    "When these patients were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratio for lung-volume-reduction surgery as compared with medical therapy was 190,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 53,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 10 years.",
    "Subgroup analyses identified patients with predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity after pulmonary rehabilitation who had lower mortality and better functional status than patients who received medical therapy.",
    "The cost-effectiveness ratio in this subgroup was 98,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 3 years and 21,000 dollars at 10 years.",
    "Bootstrap analysis revealed substantial uncertainty for the subgroup and 10-year estimates.",
    "Given its cost and benefits over three years of follow-up, lung-volume-reduction surgery is costly relative to medical therapy.",
    "Although the predictions are subject to substantial uncertainty, the procedure may be cost effective if benefits can be maintained over time.",
    "Long work hours and work shifts of an extended duration (> or =24 hours) remain a hallmark of medical education in the United States.",
    "Yet their effect on health and safety has not been evaluated with the use of validated measures.",
    "We conducted a prospective nationwide, Web-based survey in which 2737 residents in their first postgraduate year (interns) completed 17,003 monthly reports that provided detailed information about work hours, work shifts of an extended duration, documented motor vehicle crashes, near-miss incidents, and incidents involving involuntary sleeping.",
    "The odds ratios for reporting a motor vehicle crash and for reporting a near-miss incident after an extended work shift, as compared with a shift that was not of extended duration, were 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.3) and 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 6.3), respectively.",
    "In a prospective analysis, every extended work shift that was scheduled in a month increased the monthly risk of a motor vehicle crash by 9.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 14.7 percent) and increased the monthly risk of a crash during the commute from work by 16.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 7.8 to 24.7 percent).",
    "In months in which interns worked five or more extended shifts, the risk that they would fall asleep while driving or while stopped in traffic was significantly increased (odds ratios, 2.39 [95 percent confidence interval, 2.31 to 2.46] and 3.69 [95 percent confidence interval, 3.60 to 3.77], respectively).",
    "Extended-duration work shifts, which are currently sanctioned by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, pose safety hazards for interns.",
    "These results have implications for medical residency programs, which routinely schedule physicians to work more than 24 consecutive hours.",
    "Thrombin, a pluripotential effector enzyme with prothrombotic, proinflammatory, and mitogenic properties, plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology and clinical expression of atherothrombotic coronary artery disease.",
    "Existing anticoagulant drugs have not been shown to attenuate thrombin generation or activity consistently.",
    "We sought to investigate the effect of DX-9065a on thrombin generation and inhibition in patients with stable CAD.",

    "The analyses used data collected from the 1,218 subjects who were randomized in the NETT.",
    "Patients completed evaluations before and after completion of the prerandomization phase of the NETT pulmonary rehabilitation program.",
    "Using data obtained prior to participation in the rehabilitation program, QOL measures were evaluated against physiologic and functional criteria using correlational analysis.",
    "The physiologic criteria included estimates of emphysema severity based on FEV(1) and measures of Pao(2) obtained with the subject at rest and breathing room air.",
    "Functional measures included the 6-min walk distance (6MWD), maximum work, and hospitalizations in the prior 3 months.",
    "Correlation coefficients between QOL measures ranged from -0.31 to 0.70.",
    "In comparison to normative samples, scores on general QOL measures were low, suggesting that the NETT participants were quite ill. All QOL measures were modestly but significantly correlated with FEV(1), maximum work, and 6MWD.",
    "Patients who had stayed overnight in a hospital in the prior 3 months reported lower QOL on average than those who had not been hospitalized.",
    "There were significant improvements for all QOL measures following the rehabilitation program, and improvements in QOL were correlated with improvements in 6MWD.",

    "We conducted a randomized trial at 30 centers to determine whether intraoperative cooling during open craniotomy would improve the outcome among patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",
    "A total of 1001 patients with a preoperative World Federation of Neurological Surgeons score of I, II, or III (\"good-grade patients\"), who had had a subarachnoid hemorrhage no more than 14 days before planned surgical aneurysm clipping, were randomly assigned to intraoperative hypothermia (target temperature, 33 degrees C, with the use of surface cooling techniques) or normothermia (target temperature, 36.5 degrees C).",
    "Patients were followed closely postoperatively and examined approximately 90 days after surgery, at which time a Glasgow Outcome Score was assigned.",
    "There were no significant differences between the group assigned to intraoperative hypothermia and the group assigned to normothermia in the duration of stay in the intensive care unit, the total length of hospitalization, the rates of death at follow-up (6 percent in both groups), or the destination at discharge (home or another hospital, among surviving patients).",
    "At the final follow-up, 329 of 499 patients in the hypothermia group had a Glasgow Outcome Score of 1 (good outcome), as compared with 314 of 501 patients in the normothermia group (66 percent vs. 63 percent; odds ratio, 1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.48; P=0.32).",

    "The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) was a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing medical treatment plus lung-volume-reduction surgery (LVRS) to medical treatment alone for the treatment of severe emphysema.",
    "The primary outcomes specified for the trial were mortality from all causes and change in functional status as indicated by the change in maximum exercise capacity measured two years after randomization.",
    "A secondary objective of the trial was to define criteria to identify subgroups of patients at risk of harm or benefit from LVRS.",
    "Stopping guidelines for safety and efficacy based on 30-day mortality and a combination of overall mortality and functional status at two years were specified at the inception of the trial.",
    "Although specific subgroups of patients likely to benefit were not identified in advance, several clinical factors were specified as likely to be important in defining subgroups with differential outcome.",
    "In May 2001, with 40% of expected deaths accrued, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board determined that a subgroup of patients was at significantly higher risk of 30-day mortality from LVRS without counterbalancing evidence of functional benefit, and recommended that the protocol be modified to exclude further randomization of such patients.",
    "The trial's sponsor, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, accepted the recommendation, which was rapidly communicated to participating clinics.",
    "This paper describes the operational aspects of identification of the subgroup and implementation of the recommendation to continue the trial, but to terminate enrollment of new patients in the subgroup.",
    "These aspects include notification of the investigators, the institutional review boards, the Research Group, the patients and the medical community.",
    "We also describe the repercussions of the publication and the misinterpretations of the results based on media coverage.",
    "We sought to identify predictors of operative mortality, pulmonary morbidity, and cardiovascular morbidity after lung volume reduction surgery.",
    "Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.",
    "Candidate predictors included demographic characteristics, physical condition characteristics, pulmonary function measures, measures of the distribution of emphysema as determined by radiologists and by means of computerized analysis of chest computed tomographic scans, and measures of exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life.",
    "End points analyzed were operative mortality (death within 90 days of the operation), major pulmonary morbidities (tracheostomy, failure to wean, reintubation, pneumonia, and ventilator for > or =3 days), and cardiovascular morbidities (infarction, pulmonary embolus, or arrhythmia requiring treatment).",
    "Five hundred eleven patients in the non-high-risk group of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial underwent lung volume reduction.",
    "The incidence of operative mortality was 5.5%, major pulmonary morbidity occurred in 29.8% of patients, and cardiovascular morbidity occurred in 20.0% of patients.",
    "Predictors for these end points are as follows: [table: see text].",
    "Although lung volume reduction can be performed in selected patients with acceptable mortality, the incidence of major cardiopulmonary morbidity remains high.",
    "The lone predictor for operative mortality of lung volume reduction was the presence of non-upper-lobe-predominant emphysema, as assessed by the radiologist.",
    "Pulmonary morbidity can be expected in elderly patients who have a low diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and forced expiratory volume in 1 second.",
    "When assessing morbidity, the computer-assisted chest computed tomographic analysis proved useful only in predicting cardiovascular complications.",
    "Our goal is to determine short-term intraindividual biologic and measurement variability in spirometry of patients with a wide range of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity, using datasets from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) and the Lung Health Study (LHS).",
    "This may be applied to determine criteria that can be used to assess a clinically meaningful change in spirometry.",
    "A total of 5,886 participants from the LHS and 1,215 participants from the NETT performed prebronchodilator spirometry during two baseline sessions.",
    "We analyzed varying criteria for absolute and percent change of FEV(1) and FVC to determine which criterion was met by 90% of the participants.",
    "The mean +/- SD FEV(1) for the initial session was 2.64 +/- 0.60 L (75.1 +/- 8.8% predicted) for the LHS and 0.68 +/- 0.22 L (23.7 +/- 6.5% predicted) for the NETT.",
    "The mean +/- SD number of days between test sessions was 24.9 +/- 17.1 for the LHS and 85.7 +/- 21.7 for the NETT.",
    "As the degree of obstruction increased, the intersession percent difference of FEV(1) increased.",
    "However, the absolute difference between tests remained relatively constant despite the severity of obstruction (0.106 +/- 0.10 L).",
    "Over 90% of participants had an intersession FEV(1) difference of less than 225 ml irrespective of the severity of obstruction.",
    "Absolute changes in FEV(1) rather than percent change should be used to determine whether patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have improved or worsened between test sessions.",
    "Limited data exist describing risk factors for mortality in patients having predominantly emphysema.",
    "A total of 609 patients with severe emphysema (ages 40-83 yr; 64.2% male) randomized to the medical therapy arm of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial formed the study group.",
    "Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors for all-cause mortality.",
    "Risk factors examined included demographics, body mass index, physiologic data, quality of life, dyspnea, oxygen utilization, hemoglobin, smoking history, quantitative emphysema markers on computed tomography, and a modification of a recently described multifunctional index (modified BODE).",
    "Overall, high mortality was seen in this cohort (12.7 deaths per 100 person-years; 292 total deaths).",
    "In multivariate analyses, increasing age (p=0.001), oxygen utilization (p=0.04), lower total lung capacity % predicted (p=0.05), higher residual volume % predicted (p=0.04), lower maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing workload (p=0.002), greater proportion of emphysema in the lower lung zone versus the upper lung zone (p=0.005), and lower upper-to-lower-lung perfusion ratio (p=0.007), and modified BODE (p=0.02) were predictive of mortality.",
    "FEV1 was a significant predictor of mortality in univariate analysis (p=0.005), but not in multivariate analysis (p=0.21).",
    "Although patients with advanced emphysema experience significant mortality, subgroups based on age, oxygen utilization, physiologic measures, exercise capacity, and emphysema distribution identify those at increased risk of death.",
    "The National Emphysema Treatment Trial defined subgroups of patients with severe emphysema in whom lung-volume-reduction surgery (LVRS) improved survival and function at 2 years.",
    "Two additional years of follow-up provide valuable information regarding durability.",
    "A total of 1218 patients with severe emphysema were randomized to receive LVRS or medical treatment.",
    "We present updated analyses (4.3 versus 2.4 years median follow-up), including 40% more patients with functional measures 2 years after randomization.",
    "The intention-to-treat analysis of 1218 randomized patients demonstrates an overall survival advantage for LVRS, with a 5-year risk ratio (RR) for death of 0.86 (p = 0.02).",
    "Improvement was more likely in the LVRS than in the medical group for maximal exercise through 3 years and for health-related quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) through 4 years.",
    "Updated comparisons of survival and functional improvement were consistent with initial results for four clinical subgroups of non-high-risk patients defined by upper-lobe predominance and exercise capacity.",
    "After LVRS, the upper-lobe patients with low exercise capacity demonstrated improved survival (5-year RR, 0.67; p = 0.003), exercise throughout 3 years (p < 0.001), and symptoms (SGRQ) through 5 years (p < 0.001 years 1 to 3, p = 0.01 year 5).",
    "Upper-lobe-predominant and high-exercise-capacity LVRS patients obtained no survival advantage but were likely to improve exercise capacity (p < 0.01 years 1 to 3) and SGRQ (p < 0.01 years 1 to 4).",
    "Effects of LVRS are durable, and it can be recommended for upper-lobe-predominant emphysema patients with low exercise capacity and should be considered for palliation in patients with upper-lobe emphysema and high exercise capacity.",
    "An A-CASI survey of 197 men with a history of incarceration, ages 18-29, revealed that 50% and 17% of participants, respectively, had used substances or had sex while confined.",
    "Univariate regression analyses indicated that these two behaviors were correlated and both were associated with being older, having spent more years incarcerated, being sexual abused, and being involved with gangs and violence during incarceration.",
    "Multiple regression analyses showed that the likelihood of any substance use during incarceration was higher for men who were affiliated with a gang.",
    "Men were more likely to have had sex during incarceration if they reported having had a male sex partner in the community.",
    "The prevalence of sexual behavior also differed across sites.",
    "Findings document the occurrence of substance use and sexual behavior among incarcerated men, and highlight the need for continued research into the context of these behaviors.",
    "We examined the influence of attitudes concerning HIV transmission, safe sex, and sexual sensation seeking, as well as negotiated risk reduction with primary partners, on the proportion of unprotected sexual partners (%UASP) among men who have sex with men (MSM).",
    "Participants were 263 HIV-seropositive and 238 HIV-seronegative MSM in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 1999 and 2003 who completed a 20-item attitude survey twice.",
    "Behavioral data were collected concurrently and 6-12 months after each survey.",
    "Among seropositives, decreased HIV concern and increased safer sex fatigue were associated with higher %UASP at 6 and 12 months.",
    "Among seronegatives, increased %UASP at 12 months was associated with safer sex fatigue.",
    "At 6 months and 12 months, risk reduction agreements were associated with increased %UASP among seronegatives in seroconcordant monogamous relationships, reflecting their abandonment of condoms in such partnerships.",
    "We conclude that HIV prevention efforts should target modifiable attitudes (reduced concern about HIV and safer sex fatigue) and increases in sexual risk-taking of MSM, particularly among HIV+ men having sex with serodiscordant partners.",
    "Here we report the genome sequence of the honeybee Apis mellifera, a key model for social behaviour and essential to global ecology through pollination.",
    "Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others.",
    "Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization.",
    "Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour.",
    "Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement.",
    "Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are at considerable risk for HIV infection.",
    "A convenience sample of BMSM (n=252) attending nightclubs in three North Carolina cities was surveyed to investigate factors associated with unprotected anal intercourse (UAI).",
    "About 45% reported UAI in the past 2 months.",
    "BMSM who strongly agreed that their male friends used condoms for anal sex were significantly less likely to report any UAI.",
    "Recently incarcerated men were significantly more likely to report unprotected insertive anal sex.",
    "In secondary analyses, men who reported experiencing discrimination based on their race and nongay identified men reported more favorable peer norms for condom use.",
    "Men who reported that their family disapproved of their being gay were more likely to have been incarcerated in the past 2 months.",
    "HIV prevention for BMSM must promote supportive peer norms for condom use and address incarceration, racial discrimination, and family disapproval.",
    "Abnormalities in neurocognitive function are common after surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, even among patients with good functional outcomes.",
    "The time course of neurocognitive recovery, along with the long-term effects of mild intraoperative hypothermia (33 degrees C) and aneurysm location, is unknown.",
    "We determined these in a subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients enrolled in the Intraoperative Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial (IHAST).",
    "We performed a longitudinal, multicenter, prospective, blinded study of adult IHAST patients with a Glasgow Outcome Score=1 or 2 (independent function), 3 months postsurgery and a matched control group (n=45).",
    "Subjects were tested with a 5-test cognitive function battery and standard neurological evaluations at 3, 9 and 15 months postsurgery.",
    "The primary outcome measure was a composite score on cognitive test performance.",
    "There were 303 IHAST patients available for inclusion: 218 eligible, 185 enrolled (89 hypothermic, 96 normothermic).",
    "Significant cognitive improvement was noted from 3 to 9 (P<0.001) and 3 to 15 (P<0.001) months in both hypothermic and normothermic groups, even after adjusting for practice effects observed in the control group.",
    "No significant change was identified between 9 and 15 months.",
    "Neither mild hypothermia nor aneurysm location (anterior communicating artery versus others) had a significant effect on recovery over time or frequency of cognitive impairment.",
    "Compared with control group, the frequency of cognitive impairment (Z score <-1.96) in all patients at 3, 9 and 15 months was 36%, 26% and 23%, respectively.",
    "In this population, cognitive improvement continued beyond 3 months, with a plateau between 9 and 15 months.",

    "Characteristics of these 16 patients include 87.5% male; median serum AAT level, 55.5 mg/dL; age, 66 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), 27% predicted; and 50% had upper-lobe-predominant emphysema.",
    "All 10 subjects randomized to LVRS underwent the procedure.",
    "Although the small number of subjects hampered statistical analysis, 2-year mortality was higher with surgery (20% versus 0%) than with medical treatment.",
    "Comparison of outcomes between the 10 AAT-deficient and the 554 AAT-replete subjects undergoing LVRS showed a greater increase in exercise capacity at 6 months in replete subjects and a trend toward lower and shorter duration FEV1 rise in deficient individuals.",
    "This study extends to 49 cases the published experience of LVRS in severe AAT deficiency.",
    "Although the small number of subjects precludes firm conclusions, trends of lower magnitude and duration of FEV1 rise after surgery in AAT-deficient versus AAT-replete subjects and higher mortality in deficient individuals randomized to surgery versus medical treatment suggest caution in recommending LVRS in AAT deficiency.",

    "The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.",
    "RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUMMARY STATEMENT: 1.",
    "Left upper quadrant (LUQ, Palmer's) laparoscopic entry should be considered in patients with suspected or known periumbilical adhesions or history or presence of umbilical hernia, or after three failed insufflation attempts at the umbilicus.",
    "(II-2 A) Other sites of insertion, such as transuterine Veress CO(2) insufflation, may be considered if the umbilical and LUQ insertions have failed or have been considered and are not an option.",
    "(I-A) 2.",
    "The various Veress needle safety tests or checks provide very little useful information on the placement of the Veress needle.",
    "It is therefore not necessary to perform various safety checks on inserting the Veress needle; however, waggling of the Veress needle from side to side must be avoided, as this can enlarge a 1.6 mm puncture injury to an injury of up to 1 cm in viscera or blood vessels.",
    "(II-1 A) 3.",
    "The Veress intraperitoneal (VIP-pressure </= 10 mm Hg) is a reliable indicator of correct intraperitoneal placement of the Veress needle; therefore, it is appropriate to attach the CO(2) source to the Veress needle on entry.",
    "(II-1 A) 4.",
    "Elevation of the anterior abdominal wall at the time of Veress or primary trocar insertion is not routinely recommended, as it does not avoid visceral or vessel injury.",
    "(II-2 B) 5.",
    "The angle of the Veress needle insertion should vary according to the BMI of the patient, from 45 degrees in non-obese women to 90 degrees in obese women.",
    "(II-2 B) 6.",
    "The volume of CO(2) inserted with the Veress needle should depend on the intra-abdominal pressure.",
    "Adequate pneumoperitoneum should be determined by a pressure of 20 to 30 mm Hg and not by predetermined CO(2) volume.",
    "(II-1 A) 7.",
    "In the Veress needle method of entry, the abdominal pressure may be increased immediately prior to insertion of the first trocar.",
    "The high intraperitoneal (HIP-pressure) laparoscopic entry technique does not adversely affect cardiopulmonary function in healthy women.",
    "(II-1 A) 8.",
    "The open entry technique may be utilized as an alternative to the Veress needle technique, although the majority of gynaecologists prefer the Veress entry.",
    "There is no evidence that the open entry technique is superior to or inferior to the other entry techniques currently available.",
    "(II-2 C) 9.",
    "Direct insertion of the trocar without prior pneumoperitoneum may be considered as a safe alternative to Veress needle technique.",
    "(II-2) 10.",
    "Direct insertion of the trocar is associated with less insufflation-related complications such as gas embolism, and it is a faster technique than the Veress needle technique.",
    "(I) 11.",
    "Shielded trocars may be used in an effort to decrease entry injuries.",
    "There is no evidence that they result in fewer visceral and vascular injuries during laparoscopic access.",
    "(II-B) 12.",
    "Radially expanding trocars are not recommended as being superior to the traditional trocars.",
    "They do have blunt tips that may provide some protection from injuries, but the force required for entry is significantly greater than with disposable trocars.",
    "(I-A) 13.",
    "The visual entry cannula system may represent an advantage over traditional trocars, as it allows a clear optical entry, but this advantage has not been fully explored.",
    "The visual entry cannula trocars have the advantage of minimizing the size of the entry wound and reducing the force necessary for insertion.",
    "Visual entry trocars are non-superior to other trocars since they do not avoid visceral and vascular injury.",

    "The average yearly costs of managing patients after TIPS and DSRS over 5 years were similar, $16,363 and $13,492, respectively.",
    "Cost of TIPS for surviving patients exceeded the cost of DSRS at years 3 and 5 but not significantly.",
    "ICERs per life saved favored TIPS at year 5 ($61,000).",
    "If coated rather than bare stents were used the cost effectiveness of TIPS increased slightly.",
    "TIPS is as effective as DSRS in preventing variceal rebleeding and may be more cost effective.",
    "TIPS, in all aspects, is equal to DSRS in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in patients who are medical failures.",
    "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) is a common complication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).",
    "The UK LRF CLL4 trial is the largest prospective trial in CLL to examine the prognostic impact of both a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and AHA.",
    "Seven-hundred seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive chlorambucil or fludarabine, alone or with cyclophosphamide (FC).",
    "The incidence pretreatment of a positive DAT was 14%.",
    "Ten percent developed AHA.",
    "The DAT correctly predicted the development, or not, of AHA after therapy in 83% of cases, however only 28% of DAT-positive patients developed AHA.",
    "Of 299 patients tested both before and after treatment, those treated with single-agent fludarabine were most likely to remain DAT positive and to change from negative to positive.",
    "Patients treated with chlorambucil or fludarabine were more than twice as likely to develop AHA as those receiving FC.",
    "In a multivariate analysis, stage C disease and high beta2 microglobulin were independent predictors of a positive DAT result.",
    "AHA, or a positive DAT, with or without AHA, independently predicted for reduced overall survival (OS).",
    "Four deaths, all on fludarabine monotherapy, were attributed to AHA.",
    "In conclusion, DAT status at the time of initiation of therapy provides a new prognostic indicator, although FC may protect against AHA.",
    "This trial was registered at http://isrctn.org as no.",
    "58585610.",
    "We sought to determine whether depressive or anxiety symptoms are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalization or mortality.",
    "These data were collected as part of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), a randomized controlled trial of lung volume reduction surgery vs continued medical treatment conducted at 17 clinics across the United States between January 29, 1998, and July 31, 2002.",
    "Prospective cohort study among participants in the NETT with emphysema and severe airflow limitation who were randomized to medical therapy.",
    "Primary outcomes were 1- and 3-year mortality, as well as COPD or respiratory-related hospitalization or emergency department visit during the 1-year follow-up period.",
    "Of 610 patients randomized to medical therapy, complete data on hospitalization and mortality were available for 3 years of follow-up for 603 patients (98.9%).",
    "Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire, and anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.",
    "Among 610 subjects, 40.8% had at least mild to moderate depressive symptoms.",
    "Patients in the highest quintile of BDI score (BDI score, >or=15) had an increased risk of respiratory hospitalization in unadjusted analysis compared with patients in the lowest quintile (BDI score, < 5) (odds ratio [OR], 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.93).",
    "After adjustment for disease severity, this relationship was no longer statistically significant.",
    "The adjusted risk of 3-year mortality was increased among those in the highest quintile of BDI score (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.42-5.29) compared with those in the lowest quintile.",
    "Anxiety was not associated with hospitalization or mortality in this population.",
    "Depressive symptoms are common in patients with severe COPD and are treated in few subjects.",
    "Depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk for 3-year mortality but not 1-year mortality or hospitalization."
